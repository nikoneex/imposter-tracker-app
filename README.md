# Fake Crews

Fake Crews is a web tool which assists in keeping track of your fellow crewmates. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the video game Among Us by [InnerSloth](http://www.innersloth.com/gameAmongUs.php)

## Why?

Fake Crews is a personal project built to practice and display my current skillset. I hope you find it useful!

## Contributions

Though it is a personal project, I'm planning to continue develop it and add more functionality. Always open to suggestions from the community.

This project now includes contributions from [Kevyn Sisante](https://github.com/ksisant3)
